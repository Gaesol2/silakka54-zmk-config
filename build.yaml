# control, add individual board + shield combinations to
# the `include` property, e.g:
#
# board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
# shield: [ "corne_left", "corne_right" ]
# include:
#   - board: bdn9_rev2
#   - board: nice_nano_v2
#     shield: reviung41
#
# Note: Using lily58 shield (which has ZMK Studio physical layout support)
# The Silakka54 is a 54-key variant, with 4 unused keys mapped to &none
